Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions. We have taken them all into account in our revised text. Our point-by-point responses to your comments are given below.

1 (On the carbon cycle IRF). These are good suggestions. The “pool” nomenclature used follows Millar et al., 2017. In the revision, we have used your suggestion of calling this carbon cycle model a "4-timescale IRF" where possible. When referring to the model carbon stores (the R_i), we use the term "reservoirs", and are explicit that these are not physical carbon stores when they are introduced.

2 (alpha time dependency). Thank you very much for pointing out this error. We have changed the text to correct this.

3 (carbon dioxide vs carbon cycle). This is a good suggestion. We have changed the text accordingly.

4 (CH4 pre industrial units). You are correct, and the text has been changed accordingly.

5 (EBM matrix representation). This is a good suggestion, and we have re-written the equation set accordingly.

Best wishes,
Nicholas Leach & co-authors
